# Delivroo_reactNative

First of all we will have to install Expo Client on our machine so that we can use it to create hybrid apps.

```ssh
npm install -g expo-cli
npm i gitmoji-cli
```

after that we are going to generate a template or our startup app using expo-cli. 

`npx create-expo-app <app name>`

to run our app we will use `expo start` command.

it will run our app and will show us some information about our app, by `pressing ?` it will show us all the options and devices to run our app on.
